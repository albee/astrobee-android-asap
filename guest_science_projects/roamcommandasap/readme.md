# Your Guest Science Android Project

Your new project already contains all the needed components. However, you should 
personalize the following files:

1. app/src/main/res/xml/commands.xml
	Declare your commands there and their corresponding syntax.

2. app/src/main/java/edu/mit/ssl/roamcommandasap/StartRoamcommandasapService.java
	Handle your commands there and start building your code.

Happy coding!
