# Astrobee Robot Software - Android submodule (TumbleDock)

## TumbleDock Notes

`guest_science_projects` contains a template for our APK, `roamcommandasap`, and a helpful example, `geckoperchinggripper`.

Our code: `guest_science_projects/roamcommandasap/app/src/main/java/edu/mit/ssl/roamcommandasap`

Helpful example: `guest_science_projects/geckoperchinggripper/app/src/main/java/edu/stanford/asl/geckoperchinggripper`

* main/res/xml/commands.xml: defines commands you want to handle from apk
* functions in our class:
  onGuestScienceCommand
  onGuestScienceStop
  onGuestScienceStart
  onGuestScienceCustomCmd
  most important, uses command input from GDS

## About

Astrobee is a free-flying robot that is designed to operate as a payload inside
the International Space Station (ISS). The Astrobee Robot Software consists of
embedded (on-board) software, supporting tools and a simulator. The Astrobee
Robot Software operates on Astrobee's three internal single board computers and
uses the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) framework as message-passing
middleware. The Astrobee Robot Software performs vision-based localization,
provides autonomous navigation, docking and perching, manages various sensors
and actuators, and supports user interaction via screen-based displays, light
signaling, and sound. The Astrobee Robot Software enables Astrobee to be
operated in multiple modes: plan-based task execution (command sequencing),
teleoperation, or autonomously through execution of hosted code uploaded by
project partners (guest science). The software simulator enables Astrobee Robot
Software to be evaluated without the need for robot hardware.

This repository contains the libraries and API to support Guest Science
application running on the Astrobee High Level Processor (HLP). The HLP runs the
[Android Nougat](https://www.android.com/versions/nougat-7-0/)
Operating System (7.1.1). The Astrobee Robot Software exposes a Java
API that can be used either in pure Java land or Android land to interact with
robot internal messaging system based on ROS.

A distinct repository, [`astrobee`](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee), contains
the core flight software for Astrobee. Note that `astrobee` repository is
required to used `astrobee_android` (it contains all the message definitions).

Also note that the Astrobee Robot Software is in beta stage. This means that
some features are missing and some functionalities are incomplete. Please
consult [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/blob/HEAD/RELEASE.md) for
the current list of features and limitations.

Please see the [Guest Science Readme](guest_science_readme.md) for a description
of how guest science should interact with the Astrobee flight software. This
documentation also contains examples to help guest science interface with
Astrobee.

Please see the
[Guest Science Resources](https://www.nasa.gov/content/guest-science-resources)
page for information on guest science capabilities on Astrobee.
